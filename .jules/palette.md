## 2025-03-05 - Chart Color Contrast

**Learning:** When using colors to distinguish data points in charts, as well as for associated text labels, it's crucial to ensure sufficient color contrast against the background to meet WCAG AA guidelines (1.4.11 for Non-text Contrast, requiring 3.0:1, and 1.4.3 for Contrast (Minimum), requiring 4.5:1 for regular text). The original orange `#FF7F0E` had a contrast ratio of 2.53:1 against white, which fails both standards.
**Action:** Always verify the contrast ratio of data visualization colors, particularly when the same color is used for text labels. Darken the color to ensure it has at least a 4.5:1 ratio if used for text, or 3.0:1 if only used for graphical objects. In this case, darkening to `#CC4C02` achieved a 4.56:1 contrast ratio while keeping the semantic "orange" meaning.
